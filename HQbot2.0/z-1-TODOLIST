1. Set up GUI for thing to impress people more
2. Figure out "NOT" questions
3. Create optimized question searcher for Google defeating questions



Add google question = wikipedia results to googleFP_Alg
Add testGame mode where you can insert notes mid question
start thinking of how to solve googleFP vs WIKIpage like question #6
figure out question #7 ~~~~~ FIXED IT num3 was not +=ing it was just =ing and overwritting
    the number of times the earlier parts were found

Really need to make a google search that just gets whats on the google front page instead
    of throughout the whole HTML
