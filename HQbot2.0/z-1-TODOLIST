Brain Storm ~ add new things to top please
----------------------------------------------------------------------





Add google question = wikipedia results to googleFP_Alg
Add testGame mode where you can insert notes mid question
start thinking of how to solve googleFP vs WIKIpage like question #6
figure out question #7 ~~~~~ FIXED IT num3 was not +=ing it was just =ing and over-writing
    the number of times the earlier parts were found

Really need to make a google search that just gets whats on the google front page instead
    of throughout the whole HTML

Change NOT questions to tell user that it should be between one or the other question. Actually
it should be able to tell if the question is one or the other due to either it being highly found
or not found at all.

make go routines have to run in set amount of time

make the breaking up the answer only take the first word

google deep search needs to have only num1 and num2; modify google fp ; wiki can be fine

need to go over both of friday april 6ths games
