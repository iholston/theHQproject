This is a bot designed to play the popular game HQ Trivia on ios. It was specifically designed to work on my macbook pro. Won the second day after I finished the bot. Has a lot of work left but I lost interest in the project after winning and leaving college where I really couldn't show it off along with the fact that I just did not play HQ Trivia anymore. The HQbot2.0 is the one that works.
