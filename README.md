# Synopsis
This bot takes an ios screenshot of a live HQ Trivia question, converts to text with google's Tesseract-OCR, and outputs an answer to the question after scraping 
google with 3 seconds left to answer the question. Consistently answered 10-11 of the 12 questions correctly, which with the extra life bug, allowed you to win 
quite often. Built from scratch during the downtime in my required gen ed classes. This was a working bot before HQ bots became super popular. Had big plans for 
this but never finished it other than the bare bones working bot.
