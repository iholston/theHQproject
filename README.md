HQbot plays HQ Trivia on ios, and at the time was consistently answering 10-11 of the 12 questions correctly. Which with the extra life bug that was allowed to continue, allowed you to win quite often. I built this from scratch myself, HQ bots became popular at one point but I think I beat the mainstream rush.
