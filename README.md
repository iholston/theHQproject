This bot takes an ios screenshot of HQ Trivia question, uses it as input with google's tessaract, and outputs an answer to the question after scraping google. 
Consistently answered 10-11 of the 12 questions correctly, which with the extra life bug, allowed you to win quite often. Built from scratch during the downtime 
in my required gen ed classes. This was a working bot before HQ bots became super popular.
Had big plans for this but never finished it other than the bare bones working bot.
